# 📌 Experiment: C++ Pointer Basics

## 🎯 Aim
To study and implement the basics of **pointers** in C++, including pointer arithmetic, array manipulation, and string handling.

---

## 📖 Theory
A **pointer** is a special type of variable that stores the **memory address** of another variable. Pointers are a core feature of C++ that enable:
- Direct memory access
- Efficient manipulation of arrays and strings
- Implementation of complex data structures

### 🔹 Pointer Basics:
- **Declaration:** `datatype *ptr;`
- **Initialization:** Assign the address of a variable using the `&` operator.
- **Dereferencing:** Access the value stored at the pointer’s address using the `*` operator.
- **Pointer Arithmetic:** Incrementing or decrementing pointers moves them to the next/previous memory location based on the size of the data type.

## 📝 Problem Statements
The following programs demonstrate **Pointer Basics** in C++:

1. **Increment of Pointers for Various Data Types**  
   Shows how incrementing a pointer behaves differently for `int`, `float`, and `char`.

2. **Addition and Subtraction using Pointers**  
   Demonstrates moving pointers forward and backward in memory.

3. **Array Reversal using Pointers**  
   Uses two pointers to swap array elements from both ends.

4. **Display of String Elements using Pointers**  
   Traverses a string using a pointer until the null terminator is reached.

## ⚙️ Procedure
1. Declare and initialize variables and pointers.
2. Assign the address of variables or arrays to the pointers.
3. Perform pointer arithmetic operations (`++`, `--`, `+`, `-`).
4. Use pointers to manipulate arrays and strings.
5. Display results using `cout`.
